# SearchingSortingProject


This project provides a console-based program for various sorting and searching algorithms. It includes options for linear search, binary search, quadratic sorting, O(n*log(n)) sorting, and sorting performance analysis.

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dodgert87/SearchingSortingProject.git

2. cd your-repository:

3. Build the project:
   
   javac Main.java

4. Run it.
   java Main

### Sorting and Searching Options:

    1. Linear Searching: Search for a value in a list using the linear search algorithm.

    2. Binary Searching: Search for a value in a sorted list using the binary search algorithm.

    3. O(n^2) Type of Sorting (Bubble Sort): Sort a list using the bubble sort algorithm.

    4. O(n*log(n)) Type of Sorting (Merge Sort): Sort a list using the merge sort algorithm.

    5. Sorting Performance: Evaluate and compare the performance of sorting algorithms on datasets of various sizes.
